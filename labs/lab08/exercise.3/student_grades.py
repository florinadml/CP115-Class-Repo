# Input variables

test = 5
grade1 = 78
grade2 = 85
grade3 = 92
grade4 = 67
grade5 = 88
full_marks = 100
total_full_marks = 500

total_points = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5
averange_score = (total_points) / total_full_marks
grade1 = (grade1 / total_full_marks) * 100
grade2 = (grade2 / total_full_marks) * 100
grade3 = (grade3 / total_full_marks) * 100
grade4 = (grade4 / total_full_marks) * 100
grade5 = (grade5 / total_full_marks) * 100
